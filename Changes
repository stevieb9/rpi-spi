Revision history for RPi-SPI

2.36.3  2017-01-26
        - changed rw() so that it now returns an array, per WiringPi::API's
          spiDataRW() call. This was an oversight/bug in that code
        - fix quoting issue in a prereq in Makefile.PL

2.36.2  2017-01-22
        - fix params in pod, they weren't displaying correctly

2.36.1  2017-01-22
        - initial release (version number matches wiringPi's, plus an
          incremental trailing decimal place for updates to this module
        - we default to 1MHz speed if not specified in the new() method
        - we die() if we can't open or write to the SPI bus
        - changed to using WiringPi::API::spiDataRW() (a custom wrapper for
          wiringPiSPIDataRW(), so that we can send in an aref to the C
          functions)
