Revision history for RPi-SPI

2.36.1 UNREL
        - we now default to 1MHz speed if not specified in the new() method
        - we now die() if we can't open or write to the SPI bus
        - changed to using WiringPi::API::spiDataRW() (a custom wrapper for
          wiringPiSPIDataRW(), so that we can send in an aref to the C
          functions)
